    "## What is an Array?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can visualize an array as a collection of elements stored in a contiguous block of memory. Each element in the array can be accessed by its index. The index of the first element is 0, the index of the second element is 1, and so on.\n",

    "Each \"programming language\" has its own way of defining an array. Python for example, lets you define an array using a list. In C++, you can define an array using a fixed-size array or a dynamic array. In Java, you can define an array using the `ArrayList` class.\n",

    "At a low level, we can visualize a array as something like: `[0001 0010 0111 0010].\n",

    "In rust (which we can get somewhat low level), we can visualize an array as a contiguous block of memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "let my_array: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break it down: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `my_array` is the name of the array.\n",
    "2. `[i32; 5]` is the type of the array. It means that the array contains 5 elements of type `i32` (32-bit signed integer).\n",
    "3. `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is the actual data stored in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can imagine the memory of a computer as the grid below. Each cell in the grid represents a byte of memory. The address of each cell is shown at the top of the grid.\n",

    "In the `Rust` code, we specified that the array would take 5 elements. So the array would take 5 blocks of memory. If we were to add another element to the array, it would take another block of memory. However, in a language optimized like `Rust`, we cannot simply add another element to the array. We would have to create a new array with the new size and copy the elements from the old array to the new array. This is because the array is a fixed-size data structure. And you can see in the grid, that there is no space for another block of memory after the 5th block (even if there was, it could possibly be occupied by another program now or any other time).\n",
    "\n",
    "In `JavaScript` (NodeJS) we can use something like a `ArrayBuffer` to visualize the memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const a = new ArrayBuffer(8);\n",
    "const a8 = new Int8Array(buffer);\n",
    "const a32 = new Int32Array(buffer);\n",
    "\n",
    "a32[0] = 4294967295;\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(a32)\n",
    "// If we were to visualize the memory, it would look like this\n",
    "Unit32Array [ 4294967295, 0 ]\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(a8)\n",
    "// If we were to visualize the memory, it would look like this\n",
    "Int8Array [ 255, 255, 255, 255, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why we start by 0?\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this because of the way arrays are stored in memory. The first element of an array is stored at the beginning of the memory block. If we were to find like `[2]` in the array, we would have to start at the beginning of the memory block and move 2 blocks to the right. You can think as: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. 0 x 16 = first element / `[0]`\n",
    "2. 1 x 16 = second element / `[1]`\n",
    "3. 2 x 16 = third element / `[2]`\n",
    "4. 3 x 16 = fourth element / `[3]`"
